    <p>My website will be a space where I sell downloadable, printable art pieces that the user can purchase and print however they desire. The purpose of this website is to inspire its users by offering art and words that can make a difference within their daily lives. They can choose to purchase the downloadable and use it as a background, print it out and give it to a loved one, decorate their room with it, and many more options. The main audience for this website are women from ages 12-50.</p> 
	<p>Most women I know love to have inspiration words somewhere in their lives, whether it be theyâ€™re phone wallpaper, hanging on the mirror, or up in their house. With my website, for a small price, they can download an art print directly onto their phone or computer. It then gives the consumer more freedom on what they will desire for the piece.</p>
