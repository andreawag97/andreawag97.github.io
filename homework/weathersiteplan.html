                <h2>Peer Review</h2>
                <p>Morgan Boerup. Morgan reviewed my assingment and told me a few spelling errors that I needed to fix on my Audience description and Persona. Other than that, she said that it was very well done! I went in to my code and fixed the spelling errors that she pointed out as well as edited some of my informetion, since it was a little redundant.</p>
