            <h2>What is Alignment?</h2>
            <p>Alignment is the arrangement of elements in a straight line or the correct relative positions. 
It is such an integral part of website design that some people might not realize that it is even there. 
We make decisions about alignment by deciding how and where elements are placed on the page.</p>
            <h2>Why is Alignment Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps craft stronger and more compelling compositions.</li>
                <li>Makes things more visually appealing and less confusing to look at.</li>
                <li>Can create a better user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Good Example</h3>
            
            <figure>
            <img alt="Picture of good alignment" src="../images/goodalignment.jpg">
            </figure> 
            <p>This is a good example of alignment because everything is left aligned, which allows the eye to flow easily from left to right and there are no orphans or widows anywhere in the text.</p>
            
            <h3>Bad Example</h3>
            <figure>
            <img alt="Picture of bad alignment" src="../images/badalignment.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>This is a bad example of alignment because the text is all center aligned, which makes it much harder for the viewer to read and there is no symmetry or balance to the layout. It is hard fot the viewer to tell where he or she should look first.</p>
